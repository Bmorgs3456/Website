# Website

This is my first build of a website. It will NOT be going live, but is currently WIP so any feedback and/or suggestions would be very much appreciated.

Provides an insight into my understanding of HTML, CSS and JS, as well as my ability to create a website.

This has been committed to git and will have updated versions every so often.
